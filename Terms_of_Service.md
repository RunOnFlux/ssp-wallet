### 1. **Self-Custody Responsibility**
SSP Wallet is a self-custody cryptocurrency wallet. You are entirely responsible for managing and securing your **seed phrases**, wallet addresses, and digital assets. We do not store, manage, or have access to your **seed phrases, passwords, or private keys**. Any loss, compromise, or unauthorized access to your wallet is solely your responsibility.

If you lose your **seed phrase or password**, we **cannot** assist in recovering your assets. It is critical that you securely store your **seed phrase** in a safe and offline location.

### 2. **Third-Party Services and Integrations**
SSP Wallet provides access to third-party services, including but not limited to:
- **Cryptocurrency swaps and exchanges** (including QuickSwap and other decentralized exchange solutions)
- **Onramp and offramp services** for purchasing and selling cryptocurrencies
- **Integration with decentralized applications (DApps)**

These services are operated by independent providers. We do not control, endorse, or guarantee their availability, functionality, or security. When using third-party services, their respective terms and conditions apply. SSP Wallet is not liable for any loss, errors, or security breaches resulting from these services.

### 3. **QuickSwap - Swap Crypto Solution**
SSP Wallet integrates QuickSwap and other decentralized exchange (DEX) solutions to allow users to swap cryptocurrencies quickly and efficiently. However, all swaps are executed on third-party platforms, and SSP Wallet does not facilitate or process the transactions directly. 

#### **Key Considerations When Using QuickSwap:**
- Transactions occur on the blockchain and are **irreversible** once executed.
- Exchange rates and liquidity are determined by third-party liquidity providers and can fluctuate rapidly.
- **Floating rates apply:** The final amount received may differ from the initially displayed estimate due to market volatility and liquidity conditions.
- Network fees (gas fees) apply and vary depending on blockchain congestion.
- SSP Wallet **does not provide support or guarantees** for transactions executed via QuickSwap or any other third-party service.
- Users must verify all swap details before confirming any transactions. If any issues arise, users must contact the respective third-party service provider for support.

### 4. **Purchasing and Selling Cryptocurrencies**
SSP Wallet provides access to third-party cryptocurrency onramp and offramp services that allow users to purchase and sell digital assets. These services are provided by independent financial institutions, payment processors, and cryptocurrency exchanges. 

#### **Important Notes About Purchasing Cryptocurrencies:**
- Transactions are processed through third-party providers, not SSP Wallet.
- Payment methods, fees, and exchange rates vary depending on the provider.
- Users must complete identity verification (KYC) as required by third-party providers.
- SSP Wallet does not guarantee the availability, speed, or security of these services.

#### **Important Notes About Selling Cryptocurrencies:**
- Cryptocurrency sales are processed through third-party offramp providers.
- Settlement times and payout methods depend on the service provider.
- **Floating rates may apply**, meaning the final amount received may differ from the quoted price.
- Fees may apply and vary based on market conditions and third-party policies.
- SSP Wallet **is not responsible** for any transaction delays or failures caused by third-party services.

Before using any purchase or sell service, users must review and accept the terms and conditions of the third-party provider.

### 5. **No Liability for Losses or Discrepancies**
SSP Wallet is not responsible for:
- Loss of funds due to bugs, technical errors, or issues with third-party services.
- Inaccuracies in displayed balances or transaction statuses caused by network congestion, API errors, or service delays.
- **Discrepancies between quoted and actual exchange rates** due to floating-rate fluctuations in swap and trading services.
- Loss of funds due to incorrect addresses or unauthorized transactions.

Users must double-check all transaction details before confirming any transaction. Once a cryptocurrency transaction is broadcast, it is **irreversible**.

### 6. **Inherent Risks of Cryptocurrency Transactions**
By using SSP Wallet, you acknowledge the risks involved, including but not limited to:
- **Loss of access:** If you lose your seed phrase, you will permanently lose access to your funds.
- **Market volatility:** Cryptocurrency values fluctuate significantly and may result in financial losses.
- **Blockchain immutability:** Once a transaction is recorded on the blockchain, it cannot be undone.
