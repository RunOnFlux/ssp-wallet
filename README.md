## Why SSP Wallet?

SSP Wallet is not just another crypto wallet. It is a **true two-factor authentication wallet** designed with **security** and **self-custody** at its core. Here's how it works:

1. **Two Devices, Two Keys:**  
   - Your **SSP Wallet** contains one private key.
   - Your **SSP Key** (on your mobile device) contains a second private key.
2. **2-of-2 Multisignature:**  
   - Transactions are constructed and signed by the SSP Wallet and then signed again by SSP Key.
3. **Enhanced Security:**  
   - Keys, seeds, and sensitive data are never shared between devices, making it impossible to compromise without access to both devices.

This design ensures that **both devices are required** to authorize any transaction, making the wallet incredibly secure and user-friendly.

## WalletConnect Integration - NEXT-GENERATION ARCHITECTURE

🚀 **SSP WALLET: PIONEERING THE FUTURE OF WEB3 SECURITY** 🚀

SSP Wallet includes WalletConnect v2 support that showcases next-generation wallet architecture. While current dApps are built expecting simple EOA (Externally Owned Account) behavior with immediate ECDSA signatures, SSP Wallet uses **advanced Schnorr multisig and Account Abstraction** - providing superior security that represents the future of Web3.

### 🔮 SSP's Advanced Features vs. Legacy dApp Expectations

**SSP Wallet is years ahead of the current ecosystem:**
- **Schnorr Multisig**: More secure and efficient than legacy ECDSA
- **Account Abstraction**: Smart contract wallets with advanced capabilities  
- **Multi-Device Security**: True 2FA with hardware separation
- **Advanced Cryptography**: Military-grade security coordination

**Current dApp ecosystem limitations:**
- Built for simple externally owned accounts (EOAs)
- Expects immediate ECDSA signatures
- No support for multi-device security models
- Legacy Web3 patterns from outdated wallet architectures

### ✅ What Works (Ecosystem Compatibility)
- **dApp Connection**: Seamlessly connects to all WalletConnect-enabled dApps
- **Session Management**: Full session lifecycle management
- **Chain Switching**: Smooth multi-chain experience
- **Account Compatibility**: Presents SSP addresses in standard formats dApps expect

### 🔄 Ecosystem Development Opportunity
- **Signature Evolution**: Showcases Schnorr multisig superiority over ECDSA
- **Security Education**: Demonstrates why multi-device confirmation matters
- **Industry Leadership**: Shows dApps the path to next-generation security
- **Standard Setting**: Influences future wallet interaction patterns

### Why This is Exciting

This represents a **massive opportunity** for the Web3 ecosystem:

1. **Security Leadership**: SSP demonstrates how wallets should actually work
2. **Market Education**: Users learn to prefer genuine security over convenience
3. **Developer Innovation**: dApps evolve to support advanced wallet architectures
4. **Industry Evolution**: The ecosystem catches up to SSP's security standards

**Just like HTTPS, mobile-first design, and smart contracts required ecosystem evolution - advanced wallet security is the next step, and SSP Wallet is leading the charge.**

### Current Implementation

The WalletConnect integration serves as a **compatibility bridge** showing how advanced security can coexist with current dApp expectations. While dApps gradually evolve to support Schnorr multisig and Account Abstraction, SSP provides a smooth migration path.

**For developers:** This is an opportunity to build the future of Web3 security.
**For users:** Experience genuinely secure wallet operations with superior cryptographic protection.
**For the ecosystem:** Learn from SSP's advanced architecture and evolve accordingly.

## Technical Details

### Key Derivation
- SSP Wallet adheres to the **BIP48 derivation scheme** for generating hierarchical deterministic keys supporting P2SH, P2SH-P2WSH, and P2WSH addresses.
- Example derivation paths for popular chains:
  - **Bitcoin:** `m/48'/0'/0'/2'/0/0`
  - **Flux:** `m/48'/19167'/0'/0'/0/0`
- Extended functionality includes support for additional chains and constructing multiple external addresses per chain as needed.

### Synchronization Process
#### Initial Setup:
1. **SSP Relay Server:**
   - Simplifies the synchronization process by facilitating communication between SSP Wallet and SSP Key.
   - Synchronization starts when the SSP Key scans a Hardened Extended Public Key QR code from SSP Wallet.
   - A special identity path (`m/48'/0'/0'/2'/10/0`) reserved for SSP Wallet verifies unique wallet instances.
   - [SSP Relay GitHub Repository](https://github.com/RunOnFlux/ssp-relay)
2. **Public Key Exchange:**
   - SSP Key sends its hardened extended public key (e.g., `m/48'/0'/0'/2'`) to the SSP Relay Server along with a constructed 2-of-2 multisignature address.
   - SSP Wallet validates the received address, ensuring integrity.
3. **Validation and Confirmation:**
   - Both SSP Wallet and SSP Key confirm matching derived addresses to finalize synchronization.

#### Transaction Signing:
- Transactions are signed in two steps:
  1. SSP Wallet constructs the transaction and signs it with its private key.
  2. SSP Key receives the partially signed transaction via the relay server, signs it with its private key, and returns the fully signed transaction for broadcast.

#### Offline Functionality:
- Transactions and synchronization can bypass the relay server through manual QR code scanning, maintaining security in environments with restricted connectivity.

### Encryption and Storage Security
#### Sensitive Data:
1. **Encryption Layers:**
   - PBKDF2-based password derivation generates keys for AES-GCM encryption.
   - Secondary encryption uses device and browser fingerprints to restrict data access to the originating environment.
2. **Local Data Management:**
   - Serialized sensitive data (e.g., keys, seeds) is stored as JSON blobs with base64-encoded fields (`data`, `iv`, and `salt`).
   - This approach prevents brute-force attacks and unauthorized migration between devices.

#### Session Management:
- Encrypted passwords are stored temporarily in session storage, ensuring convenience without compromising security.
- No sensitive data is ever retained in unencrypted form, even within the application's runtime memory.

#### Non-Sensitive Data:
- Information such as transaction history and balance data is stored using **LocalForge**, prioritizing performance without compromising sensitive details.

### Attack Mitigation Strategies
- **Anti-Phishing Measures:**
  - The wallet and key validate each other's public keys and derived addresses during setup.
- **Server Security:**
  - SSP Relay Server only facilitates communication and cannot access private keys or sensitive data.
- **Brute Force Protection:**
  - Physical possession of both devices and knowledge of passwords are required to compromise the wallet.
