# Self-Bootstrapping Multisig Governance on Solana

## A Trustless, Front-Run-Resistant Architecture for Autonomous DAO Initialization

---

## Abstract

We propose a secure, trustless architecture for initializing Squads v4 multisigs on the Solana blockchain without relying on a privileged signer. This system introduces a custom bootloader program that verifies a cryptographic commitment to an intended configuration, enforces signature thresholds at initialization, and performs a cross-program invocation (CPI) into the Squads program to create the multisig account. The design is front-run resistant, configuration-locked, publicly verifiable, and addresses the governance initialization paradox using cryptographic guarantees and deterministic program-derived addresses (PDAs).

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Problem Statement

Squads v4, a robust multisig framework, requires a `creator` signer to initialize a new multisig instance. This introduces a centralization risk: the genesis of a decentralized system depends on centralized authority. Moreover, deterministic PDA creation for the multisig is vulnerable to front-running, replay, and misconfiguration.

### 1.2 Goals

This paper outlines a method to:

- Initialize a Squads multisig via group consensus only.
- Enforce configuration immutability through cryptographic hashing.
- Derive deterministic, front-run-resistant addresses for both the multisig and its creator.
- Require threshold-based multisig authorization at creation.
- Ensure reproducibility, transparency, and trustlessness.

---

## 2. Architecture Overview

The proposed system consists of:

1. A custom **Bootloader Program**
2. A **Configuration Hash** as a cryptographic commitment
3. A deterministic **Creator PDA** derived from the configuration hash
4. A **Multisig PDA** compliant with Squads v4
5. On-chain **signature verification**, **config replay protection**, and optional **config registries**

---

## 3. Technical Specification

### 3.1 Configuration Hash

The configuration is defined as a structured object containing:

- Sorted list of public keys (members)
- Threshold (u8)
- Optional settings: time delay, time lock, expiration timestamp
- Optional salt (bytes)
- Domain separator (e.g., `"bootloader-config-v1"`)

**Hash function:**

```ts
config_hash = keccak256(serialize(ConfigStruct))
```

This hash acts as a unique, canonical fingerprint of the intended configuration.

---

### 3.2 Creator PDA

Derived using:

```ts
[creator_pda, bump_creator] = findProgramAddress(
  ["boot_creator", config_hash],
  BOOTLOADER_PROGRAM_ID
)
```

This PDA serves as the authorized `creator` required by Squads and is signed by the bootloader during CPI.

---

### 3.3 Multisig PDA

Derived per Squads v4 canonical pattern:

```ts
[multisig_pda, bump_multisig] = findProgramAddress(
  ["multisig", creator_pda, config_hash],
  SQUADS_PROGRAM_ID
)
```

This PDA can be computed and optionally pre-funded prior to deployment.

---

### 3.4 Signature Verification

The bootloader enforces multisig-style threshold authorization using off-chain signatures. Each member signs the configuration hash:

```ts
message = domain_separator || config_hash
signature = sign(message, member_private_key)
```

On-chain logic:

- `ed25519_program` syscall verifies each signature.
- Ensures signers match entries in the member list.
- Requires at least `threshold` valid signatures.

---

### 3.5 Bootloader CPI Logic

**Bootloader pseudocode:**

```rust
// Bootloader logic
assert_valid_config(config, config_hash);
assert_threshold_signatures(config.members, config.threshold, signatures);
assert_not_replayed(config_hash);

invoke_signed(
  create_multisig_ix,
  [creator_pda, multisig_pda, other_accounts...],
  &[&["boot_creator", config_hash, bump_creator]]
);

mark_config_as_used(config_hash);
```

---

## 4. Security Enhancements

### 4.1 Immutability

- Any deviation from the agreed configuration changes the hash, rendering the transaction invalid.

### 4.2 Front-Running Resistance

- Salted hashes prevent PDA pre-computation.
- Allows safe pre-funding of the multisig PDA.

### 4.3 Replay Protection

- Bootloader stores used config hashes in a registry.
- Prevents repeated use of the same configuration.

### 4.4 Expiry Timestamp

- Optional expiration field in the config struct.
- Mitigates risk of future hijacking or misuse.

### 4.5 Config Registry (Optional)

- Stores decoded configs on-chain by hash.
- Useful for auditability, indexing, and transparency.

---

## 5. Lifecycle Workflow

1. **Coordination**: Members agree on the configuration and optional salt.
2. **Signing**: Each member signs the configuration hash off-chain.
3. **Funding** *(optional)*: Multisig PDA can be funded ahead of creation.
4. **Bootloader Execution**: Any party submits the transaction with config, signatures, and bumps.
5. **Multisig Creation**: Squads `createMultisig` is invoked using the authorized creator PDA.
6. **Verification**: The config is verifiable on-chain using its hash and optional registry.

---

## 6. Tooling Suggestions

To enhance user experience and verification, a CLI or frontend can:

- Generate and verify the configuration hash
- Collect and verify signatures
- Preview derived PDAs
- Submit the bootloader transaction
- Query on-chain config registry

## 7. Applications

- DAO Genesis
- Decentralized Investment Syndicates
- Autonomous Governance Bootstrap
- NFT Treasury Management
- On-Chain Organizational Infrastructure

---

## 8. Conclusion

This system enables the decentralized, secure, and verifiable initialization of governance structures on Solana. By eliminating central signers and enforcing cryptographic group consensus, it advances the ideals of trustless coordination and composability.

The bootloader pattern is modular and extensible to other multisig frameworks, offering a powerful primitive for sovereign, self-governing systems on-chain.
