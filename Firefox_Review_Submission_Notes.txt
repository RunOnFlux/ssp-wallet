=== REPRODUCIBLE BUILD VERIFICATION ===

Requirements:
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (for consistent build environment)
- Docker installed and running
- Node.js 22+ installed
- Git installed

To verify the submitted package matches source code exactly:

1. Clone repository:
   git clone https://github.com/RunOnFlux/ssp-wallet.git
   cd ssp-wallet

2. Checkout the exact version being reviewed:
   git checkout v1.25.1

3. Build deterministically using Docker:
   npm run build:deterministic

4. Verify Firefox package hash matches submission:
   # Get hash of built Firefox package
   sha256sum ssp-wallet-firefox-v1.25.1.zip
   
   # Compare with hash of submitted package
   # The hashes should be identical, proving the submitted package
   # was built from the exact source code in the repository

The deterministic build ensures:
- Same source code always produces identical binaries
- No build environment dependencies
- Complete reproducibility across different machines
- Docker isolation prevents hidden code injection

See REPRODUCIBLE_BUILDS.md for complete technical details.
