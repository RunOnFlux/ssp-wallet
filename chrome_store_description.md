SSP Wallet – Secure. Simple. Powerful.
The Next Generation of Crypto Security.
Multi-Asset Multi-Signature Crypto Currency Wallet.

SSP Wallet is a groundbreaking, open-source, fully security audited, multi-signature cryptocurrency wallet that provides the highest level of security and self-custody. Unlike traditional wallets, SSP Wallet utilizes true two-factor authentication (2FA) through a 2-of-2 multi-signature system, ensuring that no transaction can be executed without authorization from both your SSP Wallet and SSP Key.

With state-of-the-art encryption, hardware-grade security, and a seamless user experience, SSP Wallet is designed to be the most secure way to store, send, receive, buy, sell, and swap cryptocurrencies.

🔒 Why Choose SSP Wallet?
✅ The Most Secure, Open-Source Crypto Wallet
Unlike standard wallets that rely on a single private key, SSP Wallet operates using a true 2-of-2 multi-signature system:

🔑 Your SSP Wallet (browser extension) holds one private key.
📱 Your SSP Key (mobile app) holds the second private key.
✅ Every transaction requires both keys to sign, making unauthorized access virtually impossible.
This ensures no single point of failure and true self-custody of your assets.

✅ Fully Open-Source & Transparent
SSP Wallet is 100% open-source, allowing anyone to review, audit, and contribute to the code. No hidden vulnerabilities, no backdoors—just fully transparent security.

By being open-source, SSP Wallet ensures that your funds remain under your control, with no centralized authority or third-party risk.

✅ Buy, Sell & Swap Crypto
Seamlessly buy, sell, and swap supported cryptocurrencies directly within the wallet. No need for third-party exchanges—SSP Wallet simplifies crypto trading while maintaining security.

✅ First True Schnorr Multi-Signature ERC4337 Wallet on Ethereum, EVM Chains
SSP Wallet introduces the first-ever true Schnorr multi-signature implementation of Account Abstraction (ERC4337) on Ethereum, removing the need for a standard externally owned account (EOA). This is a game-changer for security across Ethereum and the entire EVM ecosystem.

✅ Full Native SegWit & P2SH Support
Bitcoin Native SegWit (Bech32) and P2SH (Pay-to-Script-Hash) support for enhanced security, lower fees, and faster transactions.
